## It Begins

<p>
I am starting my journey on writing down my thoughts on life and the world by posting here on my personal portfolio site.
</p>

<p>
I'm not entirely sure what I plan on getting out of this, but I seemingly am more in need of an outlet with the state of current events, and this feels like a pretty low stakes medium to use.
</p>

<p>
I do plan to use this as a way to document things I frequently want to remember or have quick access to, in a way that I could easily share with others when the time comes.
</p>

<p>
In a lot of ways, I already feel free just being able to flow, not caring about how pretty the site looks because I'm not being paid an absurd amount of money to make it look good. I'm able to just make something that works, and keep on rolling.
</p>

<p>
I'll keep this one short, it'll probably get archived anyways once I get some real posts up.</p>

<p>
Now let's test the code highlighter feature
</p>

```ts
function getMyBlog(): BlogMetadata {
	return {
		name: `Micaiah Wallace's Blog`,
		purpose: `To document my thoughts that I want to be public`
	};
}
publishBlog(getMyBlog());
```
